This project aims to help you learn a few things:
-How to implement authentication with Flask-JWT-Extended (for convenience) and HTTP-only cookies (standard method to store access tokens and refresh tokens)
-How to integrate an app with a PostgresSQL database locally
-How to use Hugging Face and load a pre-trained model so that we can manipulate an AI model in the context of an app
-More on react-router-dom and the standard way to apply it

Happy coding!
